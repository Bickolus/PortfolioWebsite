# Week 2: Create and Design Your Own Portfolio Website

## My Task
This week's task was, using HTML and CSS, to build a site from scratch. The site needed to have:

1. Name and profile picture presented immediately when first loaded.
2. Navigation links that work when clicked on and send the user to the corresponding section.
3. Titled images that link to the different application that I (will have) made, with the first application image being larger than the rest.
4. Having a responsive layout that changes depending on screen size. In this case, I have made a 992px width and a 768 version.


I had a lot of fun with this one, and the site ended up looking quite decent. However, it took a lot more work than expected. 
This was mostly due to me not starting with some sort of wireframe and always looking to change things due to dissatisfaction. 
Lucky for me, if there is any change I need to make, I won't have trouble since I built it from scratch and I'm familir with each and every section.
